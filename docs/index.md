We appreciate your desire to explore our campus ecosystem! Over the next two days, you'll have the opportunity to work with real hardware and software, just as it's deployed in the field. Each lab is designed to simulate real-world scenarios, giving you practical experience. Whether you're troubleshooting devices, configuring switches, or working with our software, you'll gain a better understanding of the campus lifecycle. Get ready to dive in, experiment, and learn by doing!
