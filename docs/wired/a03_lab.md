## Adding a VLAN

Adding a VLAN is a common provisioning task. Let’s use the existing Campus Fabric Studio to add an incremental configuration (add a VLAN). This VLAN will be specific to your pod and not routable outside.

!!! danger "Single Workspace"

    You and your fellow student will work together to create a new VLAN in your campus fabric using a **single workspace**.

1. Once the workspace is created, open the existing `Campus Fabric (L2/L3/EVPN)` studio.

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/vlan/01_vlan.png)

    1. Validate that the `Device Selection` still applies to `All Devices`

    2. `Within the Campus Services (Non-VXLAN)` navigate to `Campus: Workshop > Campus-Pod: Home Office` using the arrow :material-greater-than: on the right

    === "Workshop"

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/vlan/02_vlan.png)

    === "Home Office"

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/vlan/03_vlan.png)

2. We are going to add a new VLAN and add to the `Home Office` Campus POD.

    1. Click the `+ Add VLAN` button

    2. Add the `VLAN 2##`, where `##` is your pod number and click the right arrow :material-greater-than:

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/vlan/04_vlan.png)

    3. Customize the new VLAN by giving it a `Name`
    4. Add the VLAN to the Access-Pod by clicking `+ Add Pod` and selecting `IDF1`

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/vlan/05_vlan.png)

    5. Let's click `Review Workspace` to submit the staged changes.

3. Review and Submit Workspace

    1. Notice that the Studio is adding the VLAN to all three devices within the Pod.

        !!! tip "Pruning VLANS"

            Outside of this lab topology, when you add vlans to a Layer 2 leaf like this, Studios will generate the necessary configuration to trunk the new VLAN to the spines or upstream MLAG pair when using LSS.

        ??? warning "No changes?!"

            If you are not seeing any proposed changes, make sure you selected an `Access-Pod` within the VLAN configuration. (See step 2e)

    2. Once you review the changes, click `Submit Workspace`

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/vlan/06_vlan.png)

    3. Click View `Change Control`

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/vlan/07_vlan.png)

    4. Review the Change Control and select `Review and Approve`

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/vlan/08_vlan.png)

    5. Toggle the `Execute Immediately` button and select `Approve and Execute`

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/vlan/09_vlan.png)

4. Verify the VLAN has been added to the device configuration by using the Device `Comparison` function.

    1. Click `Devices`, the click on `Comparison`, and select a `Time Comparison`

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/vlan/10_vlan.png)

    2. Choose a device from the list, such as `leaf1a`

    3. Select a time period, for example `30 minutes ago` and click the `Compare` button

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/vlan/11_vlan.png)

    4. The first screen presented shows the overview, navigate to the `Configuration` tab on the left

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/vlan/12_vlan.png)

    5. Select the Configuration section

        !!! tip "Timeseries in CloudVision"

            We expect the configuration changed within the last 30 minutes, but all streaming data from the switch (including configuration) is stored in a timeseries database. So anything from routing table, MAC, ARP, and more is accessible for historical review and comparisons like this!

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/vlan/13_vlan.png)

5. Lab section completed! In the next lab section you will see how to roll back a previous change control

## Rollback a Change Control

There is no question at some point in  your career, there has been a situation you've been asked to roll back a configuration change and restore back to previous state. You may need to do this for all devices affected by a change, or only a subset of devices under troubleshooting.

CloudVision Change Controls are built with this flexibility in mind, granular change management per device or fleet-wide. Specifically targeting actions or tasks that have taken place can be identified and rolled back when needed.

1. Let’s roll back the change control we used to add a VLAN via Studios.

2. First go to `Provisioning` then `Change Control`. Select the change control corresponding to your VLAN addition

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/cc/01_cc.png)

3. Click the `Rollback` button

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/cc/02_cc.png)

4. In the next screen, select the top list check mark to select all the devices and click `Create Rollback Change Control`

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/cc/03_cc.png)

5. Verify the Configuration Changes section by clicking `Diff Summary`  Once you have reviewed the change, click the `Review and Approve` button

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/cc/04_cc.png)

6. Again, you'll be presented with one more opportunity to review the changes. Select `Execute Immediately` if not already toggled on and `Approve and Execute`

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/cc/05_cc.png)

7. Monitor the change control for completion to ensure the added VLAN is cleaned up on all switches.

    === "Start"

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/cc/06_cc.png)

    === "Finish"

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/cc/07_cc.png)

8. You have now successfully added a VLAN through Studios and then rolled back that change across all switches.

## Network Hierarchy

Campus networks can be rather extensive in size and their reach, including many sites, buildings, and floors where your precious network gear is deployed. The Network Hierarchy view aligns closely with the same way you'll manage your wireless access points in CV-CUE:

1. Click on the `Network Hierarchy` tab on the left

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/hierarchy/01_hierarchy.png)

2. Note your `Network` contains the workshop campus, campus pod, and access-pod as you drill down.
3. Click on `Workshop` to view a summary of all the devices deployed under the top level campus `Workshop`
4. Click on `IDF1` and note we now get more detail about the switches and clients connected to those devices in the `Overview` tab.

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/hierarchy/02_hierarchy.png)

5. Click on the `Front Panel` tab to view more detail about what's connected, the capabilities of your switches in the stack, and access to quick actions to make changes on the interfaces.

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/hierarchy/03_hierarchy.png)

6. Let's now use Network Hierarchy to drill down into a compliance issue.

### Configuration Compliance

The Network Hierarchy view is one of many ways to visualize your campus, namely to drill down to a specific area of the network to configure or troubleshoot an issue.

to showcase compliance panel and 2 devices should flagged (due to rollback above). This will open the compliance dashboard and we can sync the config from there via Change Control.

1. If you're not already on the `Network Hierarchy` page, click the tab on the left.
2. Click the top level `Network` object, and take note of the `Compliance` panel on the right

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/hierarchy/04_hierarchy.png)

3. We have 2 devices that are violating the `Configuration` compliance item

4. Click on `Compliance` and you should see the `Compliance Overview` with our 2 devices out of configuration compliance

5. Let's select your device below and click `Sync Config`

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/hierarchy/05_hierarchy.png)

6. This will create a `Change Control` with our two devices

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/hierarchy/06_hierarchy.png)

7. Click on the `Review and Approve`

    !!! tip "Why is our configuration out of sync?!"

        Recall CloudVision is designed to act as the "Source of Truth" for your configuration. It contains a designed configuration it considers the standard, driven through configuration in Studios. When we added our Vlan in the previous step, we rolled that change back, and now there is a discrepancy.

        This could be a real life scenario where a VLAN was added, rolled back due to an unforeseen issue, and scheduled to be added at a later date. We need that vlan, we are reminded the device is out of compliance, and possibly for a good reason!

8. Click on `Approve and Execute` when you're ready

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/hierarchy/07_hierarchy.png)

9. This is pushing the designed configuration back to the device
10. Let's go back to our `Network Hierarchy` or `Devices > Compliance Overview` and we should see are switches are not in compliance again.

    === "Network Hierarchy"

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/hierarchy/08_compliance_1.png)

    === "Compliance Overview"

        ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/hierarchy/08_compliance_2.png)

## Endpoint Overview

Show Endpoint Overview, search for a device on the students pod, sflow will be enabled, should be able to see more info about authentication, traffic flows, and

## Dashboards

Dashboards are an important way to visualize commonly requested information, we've already seen the Campus Health Dashboard a few times in previous labs. This lab section shows you how to navigate the built-in dashboards and customize your own.

### Campus Health Overview

1. Open the Dashboards Section and we will see the Campus Health Overview dashboard is set to our home dashboard.

    !!! tip "Dashboard Home Page"

        CloudVision has a couple features that customize a users experience. There is a built in profile for `Campus Monitoring` that can be applied to a user role, this will set the "Campus Health Overview" dashboard as the primary dashboard. A user can also select any built-in or custom dashboard as the home/primary dashboard.

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/dashboards/01_dashboards.png)

2. You’ll be presented with a curated selection of common campus related monitoring tools

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/dashboards/02_dashboards.png)

3. Feel free to explore the Campus Health dashboard briefly and then navigate back to the Dashboards landing page by selecting Dashboards in the upper left.

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/dashboards/03_dashboards.png)

### Device Health

1. Next, Select the Device Health dashboard

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/dashboards/04_dashboards.png)

2. By default, this dashboard selects all devices.

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/dashboards/05_dashboards.png)

3. Change the dashboard to select only `leaf1a` or `leaf1b` by changing from `device: *` to `device:` to match a single device. Once you’ve selected an individual device, the dashboard will filter to results for only this device.

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/dashboards/06_dashboards.png)

4. Navigate back to the Dashboards landing page by clicking Dashboards in upper left.

### Custom Dashboard

Next, let’s add a new customized dashboard. There are three main constructs we will touch on here:

- **Metrics (Devices)**: telemetry data specific to a device
- **Metrics (Interfaces)**: telemetry data specific to the interfaces of a device
- **Summaries**: a metric or set of metrics summarized into a single view

There is a lot to unpack in dashboards as you have a significant amount of power in customizing the data and look of your dashboard. See how dashboards are quickly created before we get started.

Let's get started:

1. Click the `+ New Dashboard` button.

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/dashboards/07_dashboards.png)

2. Provide a useful `Name` for the Dashboard, such as `Pod##-Student#`

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/dashboards/08_dashboards.png)

3. Next, let’s add a combination of visualizations that we want to capture
4. First, click the drop down on the upper right and change from `Metrics` to `Summaries`
5. Within the `Summaries` list, click on, or drag the `Events` widget into the dashboard canvas

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/dashboards/09_dashboards.png)

6. Within the `Events` tile now added to your dashboard, click the `Configure` button
7. Within the right side menu bar, select the following:

    !!! example "Dashboard Settings"

        | Dataset          | `Access-Pod: IDF1` |

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/dashboards/10_dashboards.png)

8. Dismiss the customization menu by clicking the :octicons-x-12: in upper right corner
9. Next, change the `Summaries` menu back to `Metrics`

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/dashboards/11_dashboards.png)

10. Within the Metrics menu, click and drag a `Table` and a `Horizon Graph` to the canvas

    !!! tip "Drag the tiles"

        You can drag the tiles around by the respective menu bars and resize each tile using the lower right corner handles.

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/dashboards/12_dashboards.png)

11. Let's configure the `Table` first by clicking the then click the three-dots :material-dots-horizontal: menu and click `Configure`

    !!! example "Table Settings"

        | Key         | Value                  |

14. Dismiss the customization menu with the :octicons-x-12: button in upper right
15. You can resize and drag the components around, but you should have a new dashboard that looks something like this.

    ![Campus Studio](./assets/images/a03/dashboards/15_dashboards.png)

16. Save and completed the dashboard customization by clicking the `Done` button in upper menu bar

## Events

In this section, we will explore the Events stream and the tools and filters to help process and manage critical errors versus informational data.

1. First Open the Events section from the menu bar:
2. Next, select a different time frame for the summary visualization, click the current time selection and change this to 1-hour
    1. You can also toggle between a bar graph and event count display
3. Focusing on the Event List next, Note the Export button to download the current Event list as CSV. Notice you can download All Events or only Selected:
4. Next, select the Gear icon to toggle Event List Roll Up. This setting combines repeated events into groups. Toggle this On and Off, watch the effect this has on the list of Events.
5. Next, utilizing the Event Filters on the right pane is important to reduce the amount of data displayed.
    1. Toggle Off the Warning and Info event Severity. Leave Critical and Error events selected.
    2. In the Type field, enter the string “Unexpected Link Shutdown” and any other interesting event types you are looking for, such as “Device clock out of Sync”
6. Acknowledge and Unacknowledging events
    1. To acknowledge from the filtered event list, select specific events and Acknowledge them.
    2. Adding a note is optional, select the Acknowledge button to mark these selected events.
    3. Acknowledged events are not deleted from the event list, only flagged as acknowledged and can be referenced by changing the filtered Acknowledgement State. Click Acknowledgement State and select Acknowledged
    4. Un-acknowledging an event can be done in the same way, click the box to the left of the Acknowledged event, and click Unacknowledge at the top of the event list.
7. Events and filtering lab section complete!

The next section will show you how to customize the notifications (Example: email, chat, SNMP, Syslog, etc) that the events generate.
